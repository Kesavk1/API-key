WHat is API?
API is known as application programming interface, it works as an intermediator between two application to share information.

QUestions we can ask?
How does weather apps get everyday weather update? 

API states the rules to communicates with the server to retrieve information , Similiar to how we cant just print ourselve a passport and follow rules
to fill application, pay fees and wait for delivery

Analogy for API system
In a restaurant, waiter can give menu, take orders, serve food and take payments, thus shielding and avoiding all behind the scenes.
Here waiter is API and you as customer get your service from system(Kitchen) using API

Purposes of API
*Access data
Multiple apps and services can use the data

*Hide complexity
Allowing devices to use in-app features to use instanly without worrying about its backend using API
 For instance, Gps feature on mobile can be used on specific app using pre-defined GPS API, rather than writing code for them
 Also, operating systems on mobile, or computer provide API for WIFI, GPS, Graphic card etc, so developers can use them 

*Extend functionality
API's can be used to add more function to pre-existing docks, widgets
It can extends features of AI assitant such as google, alexa
 For example,  API can extend or new functionlity to alexa switch to change colours or switch things

*Sccurity
They can act as security and allow or block permission to access data
Devices usually ask once for permission and save the setting forever, so its important to change or update settings manually when its not needed

The API key is an unique ID used to identify the application, it will be used by the systemm to keep the records of endpoints and users.

Different System will have different API to communicate with the endpoints to get information

Usually API will have documentation to find the input requirments and communication points.

Example, A news API gathers news and delivers in format like json, xml etc. 
 This format can be easily parse, extract information to use


SDK- Software developement kit is codes used to work with API, some devices provides pre defined SDK to work with the API

* There are various API's available in the market

Above is basic, Need more work on this..
